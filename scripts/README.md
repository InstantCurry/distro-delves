# Distro Delves Script Templates

Welcome to the Distro Delves script repository!

Each episode is loosely based around a literal script to ensure ~~all~~ most Operating Systems are tested with the same rigor and parameters.

If you have an idea for a new checklist or series, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/egee-irl/distro-delves/issues) or fork & submit a pull request!
