## What Is Is?

Distro Delves is an anti-review web series focusing looking at, showcasing, or otherwise **reviewing** Linux distributions and other operating systems.

The Distro Delves series lives on YouTube and this site is home to completed checklists and technical notes for each distro reviewed.

### Anti-Review

It's an *anti-review* series because I'm not actually ranking, rating, or really even *reviewing* distros for the series. Each episode is an un-biased overview of the distro along with a short opinion piece at the finale.

## The Checklist

The Distro Delves checklist is the nucleaus of the whole series. It is a _real_ checklist that I follow for every video in the series. Following a physical checklist makes sure that every operating system is tested with the same parameters.

**The checklist is not designed to provide a "Pass" or "Fail" outcome.**

FPS & benchmark scores can be compared across distros however as time goes on, software gets updated and the results of a benchmark become less meaningful.

**Sample Checklist:**
